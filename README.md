Objective: The objective of this assignment is to create a simple test suite for a React Native app using Detox automation tool which works on both Android and iOS platforms. 
<br>
<br>  

Unfortunately I was unable to complete the assignment due to the following reasons: 

I was using a windows machine to build this framework. 

I followed all set up steps from the ðŸ“š React Native CLI Quickstart Guide. 

This process went flawless. 

Using the new react native project, I was able to download the app onto the AVD I created. 

  

However, when continuing to the Detox installation (https://wix.github.io/Detox/docs/introduction/getting-started/), errors started to occur. 

The app would refuse to build after all Detox installation steps were followed precisely. 

My biggest challenge was that all tutorials and instructions are given from mac books. 

When getting compile errors, there is limited information from the community to fix the issues on a windows machine. 

  

Due to the above challenge, I was unable to create a working automation test suite for the react native app. 

Below are the instructions to building the project. 


This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
